**Audio production** is a difficult process for most people, and properly manipulating sound to achieve a certain effect is **non-trivial**. We present a **method** that facilitates this process by **inferring appropriate audio effect parameters** in order to **make an input recording sound better**. This page provides supplementary material to our work that gives an emphasis to **frequency equalization** (EQ).

# Frequency Responses
Using speech signals from test sub-set we compute a couple frequency responses for the **ideal** and **predicted** EQ parameters.
